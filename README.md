## Algorithmic Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various algorithmic problems from different platforms. The solutions are implemented in multiple languages, including C++, Python, and Java.
Structure

  + Each file corresponds to a specific problem.
  + File names follow a pattern that reflects the problem name.
  + Some problems have solutions in multiple languages.

How to Use

  + Browse through the files to find a specific solution.
  + Run the code using the appropriate compiler/interpreter.
  + Some files may require additional input handling for execution.

Notes

 + This repository is for personal reference and practice.
 + Some solutions may be optimized further.

Feel free to use the solutions for learning purposes!
